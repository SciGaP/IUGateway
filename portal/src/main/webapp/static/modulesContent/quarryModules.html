<td>vampirtrace</td>
<td>VampirTrace provides several variants to instrument the application source code, such as manual, automatic by thecompiler, binary (Dyninst) instrumentation and library wrapping. Besidesthese typical parallelization paradigms, VampirTrace is capable of tracingGPU accelerated applications and generates exact time stamps for all GPUrelated events. Additional highlights are I/O event and memory allocationtracing as well as recording of counter metrics like PAPI and externalcounters. To reduce the burden of the underlying file system VampirTracesupports the I/O Forwarding Scalability Layer (IOFSL), which allows users towrite the data of many trace files into one or a few physical files.VampirTrace has established a wide user base and has become an integral partof Open MPI version 1.3 and higher.Vampirtrace was compiled with the following features:OTF library and tools- ZLIB trace compression supportMPI support- MPI Fortran support- MPI-2 support for- One-Sided Communications- Extended Collective Operations- I/O- MPI trace unification libraryMultithreading support (POSIX threads, OpenMP)Hybrid (MPI/Threads) supportHardware Perf.
