			<p>
				A science gateway provides Web-based access to community-developed computing tools, scientific 
				applications, scientific instruments, and data collections to support online science and simplify 
				and expand the use of cyberinfrastructure. Scientific workflows power science gateways by 
				providing the tools to manage complex applications and collections of applications on distributed 
				computing resources.
			</p>
			<p>
				The missions of the Science Gateway Group is to support the advancement of Web-based scientific 
				research capabilities by developing open source, open community software; providing support for 
				the integration of our software into operational science gateways; providing consulting support 
				to scientific and scholarly communities for the development of new science gateways; and 
				supporting core research and development for Web and distributed computing.
			</p>
			<p> 
				The Science Gateway and Workflow Group's primary focuses are the development of collaborative 
				Web interfaces built from reusable components and network accessible services capable of managing 
				complex scientific applications and collections of applications on computing clusters, grids, and 
				computational clouds. The group's secondary focuses are providing expertise on open source and 
				open community software processes, and providing consulting support for local, national, and 
				international cyberinfrastructure projects
